PentagoAI README

To play Pentago, run the __main__ file at the command line using "python __main__.py" and follow the instructions displayed in the terminal. Playing at a depth greater than 2 will take the machine a very long time to determine a move without very strong computing power and is thus discouraged. Enjoy and good luck!
